								<p>A Framework of Composing Semantic Analysis

							<h3><i>Introduction</i></h3>
							<p>
								E-commerce has gradually been playing an important role in people’s lives.
								Therefore, we can make use of recommendation systems due to better user experience. Matrix Factorization (MF) based methods achieve fairly good performances on recommendation tasks. However, there exist several crucial issues with
								MF-based methods such as cold-start problems and data sparseness. In order to
								address the above issues, numerous recommendation models are proposed which
								obtained stellar performances. Nonetheless, we figured that there is not a more
								comprehensive framework that enhances its performance through retrieving lost
								information. Hence, we propose a novel approach to tackle the aforementioned
								issues. A hierarchical construction and a feature transformation technique are
								employed in this proposed framework. The performance excels in comparison to
								state-of-the-art models by testing on five real-world datasets. Additionally, in
								order to verify the robustness of our framework, two sparse datasets with different sizes are generated by sampling from a real-world dataset. The sampled
								datasets are much less in density. Thus, experimental results verified that our
								framework can extract useful features even under sparse data.

							<h3><i>Future Works and Contributions</i></h3>
							<p>
								In this project, we propose a state-of-the-art method which utilizes distinctive pathways to process different information. For the main review, multiple attention mechanisms are employed to extract high level information. As for the other secondary reviews, we utilize Long Short-Term Memory to retrieve the overall semantic information as feature supplement for the main review. In the experiment section, we verify that our model can handle data with various densities and give precise predictions. The proposed framework excels to capture user and items’ interactive features amongst other models. For further studies, we are going to conduct experiments on various datasets to verify the robustness of the proposed framework and other feature extraction methods will be further experimented for better performance.

									Keyword Retrieval for Data Classification on Chinese Products
								</p>
							</header>
							<h3><i>On Going Tasks</i></h3>
							<ul>
								<li>CKIP Tokenization for Chinese Words</li>
								<li>Analyze the Chinese Corpus and Retrieve Keywords</li>
							</ul>
							<h3><i>Done</i></h3>
							<ol>
								<li>Conduct ngram(3-gram) and tfidf to weight the importance of each words</li>
								<li>Eliminate words with low frequency</li>
								<li>Take product with labels(google product category) to train KNN.</li>
								<li>Utilize the trained KNN as a classifier to label the unlabelled products</li>
							</ol>
							<h3><i>Issues</i></h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Using ngram + tfidf connot represent the semantic meaning of sentences effictively</li>
								<li>Due to product information such as title, name and body_html contain only few words, KNN performs badly</li>
							</ul>
							<h3><i>Problems Sovling</i></h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Analyze keywords for each google category</li>
								<li>Utilize CKIP tokenization instead and apply the weights of tokens for voting for the final classification</li>
								<li>As for the final classification, tokenize each row of product information and check the matches of tokenized terms with google category keywords</li>
								<li>Select the highest score of the class as the label of the product</li>
							</ul>
